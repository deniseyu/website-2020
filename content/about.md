The second installment of GoCon Canada will be coming to downtown Toronto on May 25-26, 2020.
GoCon is committed to building an accessible and inclusive conference with high-quality
conversations that will grow the Go community in the Greater Toronto Area. We're scaling up to two days
this year, which means more slots for awesome Go talks!

We anticipate a diverse audience, with various degrees of experience with programming
in Go. We want to build a single-track program that is largely technical and focused
on the Go language and ecosystem, with a few introductory-level talks and
cultural discussions mixed in.
