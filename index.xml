      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the inception of GoCon Canada many folks reached out with questions about the event and organizers. So we thought why not answer these and a few others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Go programming language marked its ninth anniversary in 2018 since it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html&#34;&gt;first publicly announced&lt;/a&gt;. Both the language and the community took off  🛫, with no signs of slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.golang.org/9years&#34;&gt;Nine years of Go&lt;/a&gt; for a brief reflection. Incredible, right?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a newcomer, part of the core team, or a long time enthusiast, there is a role we all play to foster a community that welcomes new ideas and people in this complex and crazy field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoCon Canada would like to do its part in helping all feel welcome and build a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discuss a few reasons &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; speakers don&amp;rsquo;t submit proposals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide some of our favorite &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/speaker-resources/#resources-from-the-web&#34;&gt;resources from the web&lt;/a&gt; that relate to conference proposals and speaking&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>The second installment of GoCon Canada will be coming to downtown Toronto in May of 2020. GoCon is committed to building an accessible and inclusive conference with high-quality conversations that will grow the Go community in the Greater Toronto Area. We&amp;rsquo;re scaling up to two days this year, which means more slots for awesome Go talks!
We anticipate a diverse audience, with various degrees of experience with programming in Go. We want to build a single-track program that is largely technical and focused on the Go language and ecosystem, with a few introductory-level talks and cultural discussions mixed in.</description>

      <description>Putting things in order is hard. So we iterated over a map (which as of Go 1.0 is unordered) and got..
